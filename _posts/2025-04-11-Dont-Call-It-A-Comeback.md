# Don't Call it a Conference, It's Been Here for Years

This week I had the great pleasure of attending the `2025 PowerShell and DevOPs Global Summit` in Bellevue, Washington.

This is a conference that spans 4 days and brings speakers and attendees in from all over for talks and presentations that include everything from face-melting 4 hour deep dives to life-changing 25 minute sessions.

There's one common refrain that you'll hear from veterans who've been to Summit before that deserves some explanation: `This is not a regular conference.`

So, why?

I feel uniquely qualified to dive in and give you an answer with an LLM level of confidence for the following reasons:

- Number of Summits attended: 1
- Number of other conferences attended: 0
- Number of conferences ORGANIZED: also 0
- Number of opinions I'd like you to stop and listen to until I get bored: 32767

So as you can clearly see, it falls to me and me alone to present my findings in short essay format.  Come along with me.

## Vendors

### The Other Guys

Ahh vendors.  Everyone loves vendors!  They make the world go around, and without them it would be genuinely impossible to put on an event like Summit with any level of acessiblity and success.

### The Summit Difference™️

You won't find a lot of vendors at Summit.  A few carefully selected vendors have a low-key and intimate presence during the week.  These are trusted members of the tech community with genuinely useful products.

Overall they are given a respectable amount of stage time to make their pitch for bettering your life, but for the most part they are simply there experiencing summit right along side us.

## Attendees

### The Other Guys

According to a barely fact-checked answer I found in a Reddit post that was the first google search result for "microsoft ignite number of attendees", the number of attendees at the last Microsoft Ignite conference was: `5000`
That's a big audience!  I have to imagine that it's easy to feel lost or overwhelmed in a sea of people that large, and getting into some life-changing conversations about AST or what's in your $PROFILE seems less likely.


### The Summit Difference™️

The number of attendees at this conference is capped at `400`.  
That's not a typo, I didn't miss a zero, `400`
This is a deliberate choice, once intended to keep a smaller more intimate setting.  You'll have the chance to hear some amazing talks at Summit, put on by some of the smartest cookies in the jar, but where the rubber can really meet the road for you is when you meet the presenter in the hallway between talks, or end up at the same table as them during a meal or while out for some liquid refreshment.

It's not just the presenters either, your fellow attendees are out in the world making PowerShell miracles happen everyday, and they can't wait to tell you all about it.

You can learn so much at Summit, in a way that just doesn't scale with large crowds.

## It's not a conference, it's an experience.

# The Other Guys

At some other conferences, you're attending with may other people who are attending.

### The Summit Difference™️

Slack.  The hotel lobby.  The hallway.  The meals.

You're not just here at the same time as your fellow sumiteers, you're experiencing Summit WITH them.

Whether it's helpful and inclusive group chat on slack, or just the many organic opportunities for folks to make room for others or invite them to join in on what they're doing, you'll no doubt walk away with more new friendships than you can shake a stick at.

To illustrate the feeling, i'll describe to you now the context in which I write this post.

I'm in the airport waiting for my final flight of the day.  I'm only about 12 hours removed from the last few conversations I was having with my fellow Sumiteers.  Every time someone walks toward where I'm sitting and typing away I briefly believe I'm going to look up and see a new friend, coming to have a conversation.  This is what my brain has gotten used to being the norm over the last 4 days, and it's clearly become muscle memory.

## Exciting Conclusion

Call it a Global Summit.    
Call it an experience.  
Call it a game-changer.

But don't call it a conference.
